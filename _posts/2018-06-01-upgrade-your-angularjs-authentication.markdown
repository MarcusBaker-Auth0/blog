**TL;DR:** In this article, we’re going to talk about two notoriously difficult subjects very near and dear to my heart: ngUpgrade and authentication. First, we’ll cover the foundations of upgrading a real application from AngularJS to Angular. Then, we’ll look at a practical example of upgrading AngularJS authentication strategies to Angular. We’ll look at a sample app that uses machine-to-machine authentication with Auth0.
