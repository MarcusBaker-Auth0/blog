Someone’s always suggesting that you read something at Auth0. Since this year’s company offsite took Auth0 to the Pacific Beach in Panama, I thought I’d pull together a list of recommendations to fill your summer with thought and intrigue.

Lencioni goes into how those teams operate, how to generate trust, deal (and embrace) with conflict, foster accountability and ultimately get results.

It is a murder mystery set in Post World War II Atlanta during entrenched segregation. The main characters are returning veterans who are selected as the first black police officers in the Atlanta Police Department. The story is a shocking slice of life showing what it was like to live in the Jim Crow South." referred_by="Bobby Johnson, Developer Advocate (Olympia, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/NotMyself" %}

{% include book.html title="Lumen (Martin Bora)" url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EHZPI2" cover="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/beach-reads/lumen.jpg" author="Ben Pastor" description="I've also recently enjoyed Ben Pastor's Martin Bora series, the first of which is Lumen (translated from German). Lumen is part wartime political intrigue, detective story, psychological thriller, and religious mystery, and follows a German army captain and a Chicago priest as they investigate the death of a nun in Nazi-occupied Poland — but mostly it's a timely read about  conflict between institutional loyalty and personal integrity." referred_by="Jeremy Freeland, General Counsel (Leavenworth, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-freeland-108b5b1/" %}

It's a fast-paced, sensationalistic read - sometimes a little over-the-top, but recommended if you enjoy a good escapist novel from time to time." referred_by="Lewis Carpenter, CMO (Bellevue, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/lewiscarpenter" %}

{% include book.html title="Stardust" url="https://www.amazon.com/Stardust-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061689246" cover="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/beach-reads/stardust.jpg" author="Neil Gaiman" description="It’s the most magical thing I’ve ever read." referred_by="Joan Pepin, CISO/VP of Operations (Portland, Ore.)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/CloudCISO_Joan" %}

Emphasizes the importance — particularly in our current social/political climate — of standing up for those that cannot stand up for themselves, and of loyalty and self sacrifice." referred_by="Dave Wilner, Chief Revenue Officer (Bellevue, Wash., USA" referrer_url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-wilner-0a50a72/)" %}

{% include book.html title="The Power of One" url="https://www.amazon.com/Power-One-Novel-Bryce-Courtenay/dp/034541005X" cover="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/beach-reads/the_power_of_one.jpg" author="Bryce Courtenay" description="I typically like to read non-fiction so this novel of historical fiction set in South Africa in the 1930's and 1940's has enough substance to feel like I'm learning something, while telling a compelling story of a young boy taking on the world." referred_by="Mark Olson, VP of Finance and Operations (Bellevue, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-olson-565461b2/" %}

Tina Brown was Editor of Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and founded the Daily Beast. Although ostensibly a memoir based on her diaries, it reads like a novel. I enjoyed her depiction of an ambitious young Brit making her name in the US." referred_by="Aoife Crowley, Customer Success Manager EMEA (London, UK)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/aoifacrowley" %}

## History

Not long ago, I rediscovered Roman History. This book tells the story of Varus’ massive defeat in Germany that had ripple effects in Roman policy regarding expansion in Europe — the Teutoburg battle.

He’s extremely abrasive (on Twitter), to a point that I dislike. But I enjoy his writing and love the concept of “skin in the game.” For example: “Take advice from someone that has something to lose from the advice they give you.” Simple and powerful." referred_by="Eugenio Pace, CEO & Co-Founder (Bellevue, Wash., USA)" referrer_url="https://twitter.com/eugenio_pace" %}
