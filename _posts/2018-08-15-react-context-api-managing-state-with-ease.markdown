**TL;DR:** The React Context API isn't a new thing on React's ecosystem. However, the React's `16.3.0` release brought a lot of improvements to this API. These improvements are so overwhelming that they greatly reduce the need for Redux and other advanced state management libraries. In this article, you will learn, through a practical tutorial, how the new React Context API replaces the need for Redux on small React applications.

## Quick Review on Redux

Before diving into the React Context API, we need to do a quick review on Redux, so we can compare both. [Redux is a JavaScript library that facilitates state management](https://redux.js.org). Redux is not tied to React itself. Developers from all around the world have being using Redux with popular JavaScript frontend frameworks such as _React_ and _Angular_.

To be clear, in this context, state management means handling changes that occur upon a particular event that occurs on a Single Page App (SPA). For example, events like the click of a button or an async message coming from the server can trigger change to the app's state.

In Redux, particularly, there are a few things that you have to keep in mind:

1. The state of the entire app is stored in a single object (known as the source of truth).
2. To change the state, you need to dispatch `actions` that describes what needs to happen.
3. You cannot change properties of objects or make changes to existing arrays. In Redux, you must always return a new reference to a new object or a new array.

If you are not familiar with Redux and you want to learn more, please, check [this practical tutorial on Redux](https://auth0.com/blog/redux-practical-tutorial/).

## Creating a React App with Redux

As mentioned, the goal of this article is to show you how the new Context API can replace Redux for small apps. Therefore, you will start by creating a simple React app with Redux and, after that, you will learn how to remove this state management library so you can take advantage of the React Context API.

The sample application you will build is an app that handles a list of some popular foods and their origin. This app will also include a search functionality to enable users to filter the list based on some keyword.

In the end, you will have an app that looks like this:

![]()

### Project Requirements

As this article uses only React and some NPM libraries, you will need nothing else than Node.js and NPM installed in your development machine. If you don't have Node.js and NPM yet, check out the [official installation procedures](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install both.

After installing these dependencies, you will need to install the `create-react-app` tool. This tool helps developers getting started with React. So, to install it, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app
```

### Scaffolding the React App

With `create-react-app` installed, you will have to move to the directory where you want to put your project and execute the following command:

```bash
create-react-app redux-vs-context
```

After a few seconds, `create-react-app` will have finished creating your app. So, after that, you can move into the new directory created by this tool and install Redux:

```bash
# move into your project
cd redux-vs-context

# install Redux
npm i --save redux react-redux
```

> **Note:** `redux` is the main library and `react-redux` is a library that facilitates the interaction between React and Redux. In short, the latter acts like a proxy between React and Redux.

### Developing React Apps with Redux

Now that you have your React app structured and that you installed Redux, open your project in your preferred IDE. From there, you will create three files into the `src` directory:

- `foods.json`: This file will hold a static array of foods and their origin.
- `reducers.js`: This file will manage the state of the Redux version of your app.
- `actions.js`: This file that will hold the functions that will trigger changes in the state of the Redux version of your app.

So, to start, you can open the `foods.json` file and add the following content to it:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Chinese Rice",
    "origin": "China",
    "continent": "Asia"
  },
  {
    "name": "Amala",
    "origin": "Nigeria",
    "continent": "Africa"
  },
  {
    "name": "Banku",
    "origin": "Ghana",
    "continent": "Africa"
  },
  {
    "name": "PÃ£o de Queijo",
    "origin": "Brazil",
    "continent": "South America"
  },
  {
    "name": "Ewa Agoyin",
    "origin": "Nigeria",
    "continent": "Africa"
  }
]
```

As you can see, there is nothing special about this file. It is just an array with different food from different countries.

After defining the `foods.json` file, you can focus on defining your Redux store. To recap, the `store` is the place where you keep the single source of truth of the state of your app. So, open the `reducers.js` file and add the following code to it:

```js
import Food from './foods';

const initialState = {
  food: Food,
  searchTerm: '',
};

export default function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // switch between the action type
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SEARCH_INPUT_CHANGED':
      const {searchTerm} = action.payload;
      return {
        ...state,
        searchTerm: searchTerm,
        food: searchTerm ? Food.filter(
          (food) => (food.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) > -1)
        ) : Food,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

In the code above, you can see that the `reducer` function receives two parameters: `state` and `action`. When you start your React application, this function will get the `initialState` defined right before it and, when you dispatch instances of an action, this function will get the current state (not the `initialState` anymore). Then, based on the contents of these actions, the `reducer` function will generate a new state for your app.

Next, you have to define what these actions are. Actually, to keep things simple, you will define a single action that will be triggered when users input a search term in your app. So, open the `actions.js` file and insert the following code into it:

```js
function searchTermChanged(searchTerm) {
  return {
    type: 'SEARCH_INPUT_CHANGED',
    payload: {searchTerm},
  };
}

export default {
  searchTermChanged,
};
```

With this `action` creator in place, the next thing you need to do is to wrap your `App` component into the `Provider` component that is available on `react-redux`. This provider is responsible for making your single source of truth (i.e., the `store`) to your React app.

To use this provider, first you will create your app's `store` using the `initialState` defined in the `reducers.js` file. Then, you will pass this `store` to your `App` with the help of `Provider`. To accomplish these tasks, you will have to open the `index.js` file and replace its contents with:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
import {createStore} from 'redux';
import reducers from './reducers';
import App from './App';

// Creating the store using the reducers info.
// That's because reducers are the building blocks of a Redux Store.
const store = createStore(reducers);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App/>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

That's it! You just finished configuring Redux in your React app. Now, you have to implement the UI (User Interface) so your users can use the features implemented in this section.

### Building the React Interface

Now that you have the core of your application ready to go, you can focus on building your user interface. For that, open your `App.js` file and replace its contents with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
import React from 'react';
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
import actions from './actions';
import './App.css';

function App({food, searchTerm, searchTermChanged}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="search">
        <input
          type="text"
          name="search"
          placeholder="Search"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={e => searchTermChanged(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Origin</th>
          <th>Continent</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {food.map(theFood => (
          <tr key={theFood.name}>
            <td>{theFood.name}</td>
            <td>{theFood.origin}</td>
            <td>{theFood.continent}</td>
          </tr>
        ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}

export default connect(store => store, actions)(App);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For those not used to Redux, the only thing that they might not be familiar with is the `connect` function used to encapsulate the `App` component. This function is actually a [High Order Component (HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that acts as the glue between your app and Redux.

If you run your app now, you will be able to use it in your browser:

```bash
npm run start
```

However, as you can see, the app right now is ugly. So, to make it look a little bit better, you can open the `App.css` file and replace its contents with: 

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  margin-top: 15px;
  line-height: 25px;
}

th {
  background-color: #eee;
}

td, th {
  text-align: center;
}

td:first-child {
  text-align: left;
}

input {
  min-width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid #999;
  border-radius: 2px;
  line-height: 25px;
}
```

Done! You now have a basic React and Redux app and can start learning about how to migrate to the Context API.

### Redux version completed: Refactoring our App

Well, we're actually through with our Redux version. As said earlier, Redux isn't necessarily needed as the size of the app matters talkless of the introduction of the new Context API.

#### So What's A Context API ?

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In React, data is often passed from a parent to its child component as a prop. â Context, React.

##### Is the Context API a new thing ?

No, it isn't. Even Redux uses a component in the Context API: `<Provider />`

#### Using the new React Context API - Things to take note of

Using the new Context API depends on three main steps:

1. Passing the initial state to`React.createContext`. This function then returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer.
2. Using the Provider component at the top of the tree and making it accept a prop called value. This value can be anything!.
3. Using the Consumer component anywhere below the Provider in the component tree to get a subset of the state.

### Rewritting Our App - Moving From Redux To Context API

Sigh, we won't really do alot of work anymore. Migrating from Redux to the new Context API is quite easy.

The first step is removing **every** trace of **Redux** from our app. We'll start by removing the libraries from our app
```bash
npm rm redux react-redux
```

Then, we remove the below codes from `App.js`:

```js
// Remove these lines of code.
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
import actions from './actions';
```

and replace the last line of `App.js`
```js
from
export default connect(store => store, actions)(App); 
to
export default App;
```

With these changes in place, we can rewrite our app with React Context API. So, to convert the previous app from a Redux powered app to using the Context API, we will need a context to store the app's data (this context will replace the Redux Store). Also, we will need a `Context.Provider` component which will have a `state`, `props`, and a normal React component lifecycle.

Therefore, we will create a `providers.js` file in the `src` folder and add the following code to it:

```js
import React from 'react'; 
import Food from './food';

const DEFAULT_STATE = { allFood: Food, searchTerm: '', };
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext(DEFAULT_STATE);
export default class Provider extends React.Component { state = DEFAULT_STATE;
searchTermChanged = searchTerm => { this.setState({searchTerm}); };
render() { 
    return ( 
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ ...this.state, searchTermChanged: this.searchTermChanged, }} > {this.props.children} </ThemeContext.Provider> ); } }
```

The Provider class is responsible for encapsulating other components inside the `ThemeContext.Provider` so these components can have access to our app's state and to the `searchTermChanged` function that provides a way to change this state.

To consume these values later in the component tree, we will need to initiate a `ThemeContext.Consumer` component. This component will need a render function that will receive the above value props as arguments to use at will. Next, we create another file, `consumer.js` in the `src` directory and write the following code into it:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {ThemeContext} from './provider';

export default class Consumer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {children} = this.props;

    return (
      <ThemeContext.Consumer>
        {({allFood, searchTerm, searchTermChanged}) => {
          const food = searchTerm
            ? allFood.filter(
              food =>
                food.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) > -1
            )
            : allFood;

          return React.Children.map(children, child =>
            React.cloneElement(child, {
              food,
              searchTerm,
              searchTermChanged,
            })
          );
        }}
      </ThemeContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}
```

Now, to finalise the migration, we will open our `index.js` file, and inside the `render()` function, wrap the `App` component with the Consumer component. Also, wrap the Consumer inside the `Provider` component. Exactly as shown here:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Provider from './provider';
import Consumer from './consumer';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider>
    <Consumer>
      <App />
    </Consumer>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Wrapping up

We have successfully refactored our React App which was formerly powered by `Redux` to use React's own **Context API**.

## In summary

Redux is an **advanced** state management library that should be used when building large scale react apps. That is as a result of fast caching and easing the loading actions conducted by React when loading new changes effected by the state. The Context API on the other hand, should be used in small scale react apps where byte - sized changes are made. Using the Context API, we do not have to write a lot of code such as `reducers`, `actions` etc to work out the logic exhibited by state changes.
