[SLIDESHOW HERE]

“Let’s build a company we’d love to work for.”

When my “brother-in-arms” Matias Woloski and I started Auth0, this was one of the first things we discussed. Seems simple, doesn’t it? Who would build a company you’d hate to work for?

In the beginning, it was just the two of us, then a few more. We were all together. (Although not physically together — we’re a globally-dispersed, remote company.) Communication was very, very high bandwidth. If I wrote a blog post, Matias would review it, then the other three developers would do the same. The entire company reviewed my blog post before it was published. And I, in turn, reviewed their code, and we would often all sit in calls with customers. This forged “our way of life” day after day. 

An Auth0 jargon emerged in our chat that would be unintelligible to anyone from the outside. Customized emojis soon appeared. And a primitive system of checks and balances emerged as well: 

- _Is this UI experience good enough?_
- _Is this requirement really necessary?_
- _Does this fit our strategy?_

Fast forward five years, and the company has grown dramatically. 

Last year [we doubled our revenue and customer base](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-announces-record-year/) and today we are at 380 employees spread across 35+ countries! I cannot possibly review everything. Matias cannot possibly talk to all the customers. But part of what made this success possible is our way of doing things — our culture.

Whether you want it or not, “a” culture *will* emerge in an organization. 

We find ourselves asking critical questions: 
- _How can we scale this way of interacting?_ 
- _Is it possible to factor out a company’s soul?_
- _How can we codify it in a way that can be efficiently communicated, and — more importantly — lived every day?_


## What We Mean When We Say ‘Culture’

My favorite definition is probably the simplest: culture is “our way of life.” It is the collective of both large and small things like:

- What we build, what we ship, how we ship it.
- The messages we send internally and outside the company.
- The messages we don’t send. That that we chose to stay silent about.
- The reward systems we put in place.
- The behaviors we exhibit: those we accept, those we frown upon.
- The lines we draw that if crossed have consequences, escalations.
- The speed at which an important escalation reaches those in a position to act on them.
- The speed at which those consequences are acted upon.
- Our semiotics: the symbols we display, our dress code, the internal dialects we have developed.
- The rituals we put in place to celebrate and develop deeper relationships: our lunches, our AMAs sessions, BBQs, giving campaigns, our awards.
- What makes us proud and look forward to displaying something publicly, and what makes us feel ashamed and regretful.
- What upsets us, what fills us with joy and happiness.
- Our tolerance for things unusual to us, surprising, annoying.
- How comfortable we are with being uncomfortable.
- How we imagine ourselves in the future.
- The steps we take everyday to improve professionally and personally.

And many, many other things that happen in every given day as our lives touch anything “Auth0.”

## Communication + Action = Values, which leads to Culture

Some of things that form our culture evolved from the fact that, as a remote and dispersed team, we had to communicate across time zones (Slack, Zoom, Gapps). Or our practice of yearly offsites in places like Cancun or Panama where we make the most of our time together.

Our early vision and values were easily transmitted to the whole company. This communication + what every employee (including leadership) does every day = our company values. But doing that for a company that doubled in size in less than a year required more thought and care. 

Last summer, we’d grown too big to share our values only through direct action. So, our senior leadership team did a values exercise at our offsite, but as I mentioned culture and values are the sum of what leadership hopes these things might be and what every employee (including leadership) does. We also did a second exercise so that everybody in the company had a voice in what value to add, which to change, and which to remove. We took that feedback, modified our values to what we have now:

1. Obsessively deliver *Customer Value*

2. *Trust* and *respect* each other (NO BAP — more on that below)

3. Hold ourselves to incredibly *High Standards*.

4. Win through *Collaboration*.

5. *Experiment*, *Learn* and *Innovate*.

6. *Radical Transparency*

7. *Passion*

Some of these are self-explanatory. Other deserve a little bit more attention. Let’s start with: “No BAP”. No-BAP stands for “No Bullshit, Assholes, Politics.”

*No Bullshit* means literally that: we are not fond of nonsense. If we hear a nonsense excuse for something, we just call it out! 

*No Assholes*: We want people that can trust each other, that respect each other, that care. That can be vulnerable with each other. Those who can see beyond the surface of a misplaced word on Slack, or unintended action that hurt someone, and those who give others the benefit of the doubt. Insulting, offensive, discriminatory behavior has no place at Auth0. I don’t care how smart, brilliant, gifted you are. People who deliver excellent results, without caring how those results are delivered, have no place in Auth0.
