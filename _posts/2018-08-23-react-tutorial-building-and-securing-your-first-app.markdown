**TL;DR:** In this article, you will learn the basic concepts of React. After that, you will have the chance to use React in action while creating a simple Q&A (Questions & Answers) app that relies on a backend API. If needed, you can check [this GitHub repository to check the code that supports this article](https://github.com/auth0-blog/react-tutorial). Have fun!

## Prerequisites

Although not mandatory, you should know a few things about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before diving in in this tutorial. If you do not have previous experience with these technologies, you might not have an easy time following the instructions in this article and it might be a good idea to step back and learn about them first. If you do have previous experience with web development, then stick around and enjoy the article.

Also, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed in your development machine. If you don't have these tools yet, please, [read and follow the instructions on the official documentation to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, comes bundled into the default Node.js installation.

Lastly, you will have to have access to a terminal in your operating system. If you are using MacOS X or Linux, you are good to go. If you are on Windows, you will probably be able to use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6) without problems.
