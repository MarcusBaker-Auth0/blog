Creating blog posts at Auth0 is a process that involves multiple steps. In a nutshell, the following is an overview of our content development process:

- Create an outline.
- Review outline.
- Write the demo app.
- Write a blog post draft.
- Proof-read post.
- Review the final draft.
- Publish post.

At any time during this process there's an extra step that Content Engineers may have to take:

- Add assets to the content.

If the assets already exist, this step is as easy as including the assets within the body of the blog post. However, if the assets need to be created they need to be requested from the design team. If the Content Engineers were to design the assets by themselves, they would be blocked from developing and writing. This detour from the workflow would increase the time it takes to publish a post.

Thankfully, we count with a talented design team at Auth0 to whom we can delegate the creating of assets. We can ping them to put a request for assets on Slack. While they are working on designing the assets, we continue working on development and writing. When the design team is done with the assets, they ping us with a link from where we can download them. We then integrate the assets with the blog post and continue our work.

At no time, we get blocked from writing due to asset creation. The design team handles the task asynchronously on their own pipeline. The design team acts exactly how a web worker acts in JavaScript applications. JavaScript is a single-threaded language. As such, running expensive logic in the main thread can block it and make our JavaScript application seem slow or unresponsive. Using web workers, we can create a separate thread to run any logic without interrupting the main thread.

> [Interleaving](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/interleaving) means "to arrange (an operation) so that two or more programs, sets of instructions, etc., are performed in an alternating fashion."

Let's explore what we need to know to make use of web workers in JavaScript and what benefits it brings to a web application.

## Why use JavaScript Web Workers?

Let's expand a bit more on what [Jason Miller](https://twitter.com/_developit) explained in his tweets.

In JavaScript, we can create parallel programming to perform multiple operations simultaneously using [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers). Web workers let us create background threads that are separate from the main execution thread, where we usually run our user interface logic. The core advantage of this workload separation is that we can run expensive operations within an isolated thread without interrupting or affecting the responsiveness and usability of the main thread. When the background thread completes its task it seamlessly notifies the main thread about the results through an event that is managed through regular [JavaScript event handling](https://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html).

{% include tweet_quote.html quote_text="Web workers are JavaScript objects that can be treated just like any other object: you can pass them around as function arguments, assign them to class properties, and since they have a common interface, even extend them!" %}

Web workers effectively enable a form of multi-threading in JavaScript with [some restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers#APIs_available_in_workers) such as not being able to access the DOM and not having access to the web worker's parent page (the page that created it). With that in mind, let's learn next how we can create web workers.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

Getting hands-on with web workers will help us understand them better! For the purpose of this blog post, we'll be running the sample code within a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) project. It's easy to bootstrap and run a vanilla JavaScript project there. If you want, feel free to visit the [CodeSanbox that is already set up](https://codesandbox.io/s/xp901z23o4) and fork it. Otherwise, please, follow these steps:

- Visit [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/speedy-introduction-to-web-workers/codesandbox-home-page.png" alt="CodeSanbox home page">
</p>

- On the main page, click on the **Box** icon that represents a Vanilla Javascript project.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/speedy-introduction-to-web-workers/codesandbox-javascript-project-icon.png" alt="CodeSanbox JavaScript project icon">
</p>

- Scroll down and notice that the project preview is shown within the page.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/speedy-introduction-to-web-workers/codesandbox-javascript-project-preview.png" alt="CodeSanbox JavaScript project preview">
</p>

- Click on the **Edit on CodeSandbox** link to open the project on its own browser tab.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

- Delete `index.js` in the `src` folder.

- Create `main.js` and `worker.js` under the `src` folder.

- Open `index.html` and change the `src` attribute of `<script>` to `src/main.js`:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}

<html>

<head>
    <title>Parcel Sandbox</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
</head>

<body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script src="src/main.js"></script>

</body>

</html>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll soon learn why we are creating these files. CodeSanbox uses [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle the JavaScript application easily.

> Feel free to use your own environment or local configuration! If you are using Webpack, there is [extra configuration using `worker-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader) that needs to be done. We'll cover that in a future post.

## Creating Web Workers

To create a web worker, we use the [`Worker()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) constructor from the [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). The `Worker()` constructor has the following signature:

```javascript
Worker(aURL, options);
```

`aURL` is a string that represents the URL of the script that we want the worker to execute.

`options` is an object to customize the `Worker` instance. The [allowed options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker#Parameters) are `type`, `credentials`, and `name`. We don't need to configure them for the scope of this post.

In practice, we instantiate a web worker in the main thread. The main thread could be represented by a JavaScript file, for example, `main.js`, that is the entry point to the application. The web worker thread could be represented by another file, for example, `worker.js`. `main.js` then creates a new `Worker` using the `worker.js` file. Let's see this in action.

Let's open `src/main.js` in our project and populate it with the following code:

```javascript
// src/main.js

const worker = new Worker("../src/worker.js");
```

In the code above, `worker` becomes a `Worker` instance that will execute the script on `worker.js`.

> When following along in CodeSandbox, we need to specify the full path to `worker.js` for it to work properly: `../src/worker.js`.

That's it for the creation of a web worker! We effectively now have two threads available in our application: `main` and `worker`. Next, we'll learn how to communicate between threads.

## Sending Messages To and From a Web Worker

In the introduction, we discussed how the internal collaboration between our Content and Design teams at Auth0 resemble the interaction between threads using web workers in JavaScript. In our case, a Content Engineer represents the `main` thread and the Designer represents the `worker` thread. How would the `main` thread ping the `worker` thread and vice versa? We do that through the [`postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage) method and the [`onmessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/onmessage) event handler from the Web Workers API.

Let's use the classic [Marco Polo game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_(game)>) to see this communication in action. In this game, one player shouts "Marco!" and the other player must reply "Polo!". Within our context we want to do the following:

1.  `main.js` and `worker.js` are on standby listening for any message between each other.

2.  `main.js` sends a message to `worker.js`: `"Marco!"`.

3.  `worker.js` gets the message from `main.js` and replies: `"Polo!"`.

4.  **Step 2** and **Step 3** are repeated infinitely.

### Step 1: Listen for Messages

The `Worker.onmessage` event handler let us listen for messages between the threads. The signature of this `Worker` event handler property is as follows:

```javascript
myWorker.onmessage = e => {
  // Event handler logic
};
```

The function assigned to `onmessage` is called when a `message` event occurs.

To set this up in `main.js`, we use the `Worker` instance we created:

```javascript
// src/main.js

const worker = new Worker("../src/worker.js");

worker.onmessage = e => {};
```

To set this up in the web worker thread represented by `worker.js`, we use the `onmessage` property directly:

```javascript
// src/worker.js

onmessage = e => {};
```

How do we access the message data that is being sent? The message payload can be accessed from the message event's `data` property.

Let's update our code as follows:

```javascript
// src/main.js

const worker = new Worker("../src/worker.js");

worker.onmessage = e => {
  const message = e.data;
  console.log(`[From Worker]: ${message}`);
};
```

```javascript
// src/worker.js

onmessage = e => {
  const message = e.data;
  console.log(`[From Main]: ${message}`);
};
```

Let's save our work for each file. On CodeSanbox, we can use `CMD + S` or `CTRL + S` to save each file.

We got our threads listening for messages between each other. Next, let's learn how to send messages.

### Step 2: Send a Message from Main Thread to Worker Thread

To send messages, we rely on the `Worker.postMessage()` method:

```javascript
worker.postMessage(message);
```

The `postMessage()` takes a single parameter representing the data that we want to send. This data may be any value or JavaScript object handled by the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage). As noted by MDN, the structured clone algorithm is an algorithm defined by the HTML5 specification for [copying complex JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm). Why do we need to rely on this algorithm? Data transferred through web workers is **passed as a copy, not as a reference**.

With an understanding of how `postMessage()` work, let's use this method to send a message from the main thread to the worker thread:

```javascript
// src/main.js

const worker = new Worker("../src/worker.js");

worker.onmessage = e => {
  const message = e.data;
  console.log(`[From Worker]: ${message}`);
};

worker.postMessage("Marco!");
```

Let's save our work and open the application preview on its own tab. This can be done by clicking on the **Open In New Window** button present in the navigation bar of the embedded browser:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/speedy-introduction-to-web-workers/codesanbox-open-preview-in-new-window.png" alt="CodeSanbox button to open application preview in new tab.">
</p>

In the new preview browser tab, let's open the browser developer console and refresh the page. We should see the following output:

```shell
[From Main]: Marco!
```

This output in the console confirms that our web worker is listening and reacting to the `message` event sent from `main.js`. Now, we need to reverse the communication. We need to send a message reply from `worker.js` to `main.js`.

### Step 3: Send a Message from Worker Thread to Main Thread

This will be quick. We need to use the `postMessage()` method in the `onmessage` event handler in `worker.js`:

```javascript
// src/worker.js

onmessage = e => {
  const message = e.data;
  console.log(`[From Main]: ${message}`);

  postMessage("Polo!");
};
```

Let's save our work and refresh the preview browser tab. In the console, we should now see the following output:

```shell
[From Main]: Marco!
[From Worker]: Polo!
```

We have achieved bi-directional communication between threads, but the communication is short-lived. Let's make this multi-threaded Marco Polo game run infinitely.
