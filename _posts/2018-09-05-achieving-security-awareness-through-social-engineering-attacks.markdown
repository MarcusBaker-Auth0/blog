I took the ["Achieving Security Awareness Through Social Engineering Attacks"](https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/training/achieving-security-awareness-through-social-engineering-attacks.html) course at [Black Hat this year](https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/)!

It was eye-opening, tremendously interesting, and fun! It was facilitated by [Jayson Street](https://twitter.com/jaysonstreet) and [April Wright](https://twitter.com/aprilwright). Jayson gets paid by companies to break into their own facilities through [Social Engineering](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)>). He shared many crazy stories, like the time he [gained full access to a bank in Beirut in two and a half minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpX70KxGiVo&feature=youtu.be&t=434).

Here’s a summary of what we discussed in the training, along with key takeaways:

## OSINT and Social Media

> “Information doesn’t have to be secret to the valuable” ~ CIA

One of the key elements of Social Engineering is [Open-source Intelligence (OSINT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), which is insight produced from data collected from publicly available sources. **If you don’t have proper privacy settings in your social media accounts, the information you put there is public**.

We discussed a case in class of a guy named Travis who put pictures of his badge, passport, plane tickets, job title, workplace and even emails on Instagram. Really.

</p>

April contacted him and he removed some of it, but you can still find the badge on Instagram.

We analyzed how someone that overposts on social media could be targeted, and it’s not a surprise that it’s relatively simple. We also talked about tools and techniques to get and find relevant information.

There was an exercise about drafting (not sending) a spear phishing email in 1 hour targeted at someone in our organization using OSINT. Nobody used their own workplace and nobody said where they worked, but we completed the task with good results.

**Takeaway #1:** Review your privacy settings and don’t post private information on social media.
