I took the ["Achieving Security Awareness Through Social Engineering Attacks"](https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/training/achieving-security-awareness-through-social-engineering-attacks.html) course at [Black Hat this year](https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/)!

It was eye-opening, tremendously interesting, and fun! It was facilitated by [Jayson Street](https://twitter.com/jaysonstreet) and [April Wright](https://twitter.com/aprilwright). Jayson gets paid by companies to break into their own facilities through [Social Engineering](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)>). He shared many crazy stories, like the time he [gained full access to a bank in Beirut in two and a half minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpX70KxGiVo&feature=youtu.be&t=434).
