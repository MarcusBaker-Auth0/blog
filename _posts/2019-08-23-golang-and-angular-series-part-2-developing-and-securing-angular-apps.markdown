 **TL;DR:** In this series, you will learn how to build modern applications with Golang and Angular. [In the first article](https://auth0.com/blog/golang-and-angular-series-part-2-developing-and-securing-golang-apis/), you learned how to build a secure backend API with Golang to support a to-do list application. Now, in the second part, you will use Angular to develop the frontend of the to-do list app. To facilitate the identity management, you will use Auth0 both in your backend API and in your Angular app to authenticate users. If needed, you can find the final code developed throughout this article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/golang-angular-2).
