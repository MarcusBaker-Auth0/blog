**TL;DR:** In this series, you will learn how to build modern applications with Golang and Angular. [In the first article](https://auth0.com/blog/golang-and-angular-series-part-2-developing-and-securing-golang-apis/), you learned how to build a secure backend API with Golang to support a to-do list application. Now, in the second part, you will use Angular to develop the frontend of the to-do list app. To facilitate the identity management, you will use Auth0 both in your backend API and in your Angular app to authenticate users. If needed, you can find the final code developed throughout this article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/golang-angular-2).

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need to install Golang, Node.js, and Angular. However, as you will see, the process is quite simple. For starters, you can visit [the official installation instructions provided by Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install the programming language.

After that, you will need to install Node.js (which comes with NPM). For that, you can follow [the instructions described here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, after installing Node.js and NPM, you can issue the following command to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) tool:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

> **Note:** By adding `-g` in the command above, you make NPM install the Angular CLI tool globally. That is, after issuing this command, you will have the `ng` command in all new sessions of your terminal.

## Part 1: Recap

In the first part of this series, you have developed a secure backend API with Golang and Gin. If you have followed the previous article, you can jump to the next section. Otherwise, you can still follow this article along. However, you will have to fork and clone [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/golang-angular) and, after that, you will have to <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">sign up for a free Auth0 account here</a> so you can properly configure and run your backend API.

After signing up for Auth0, you will have to go to your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and proceed as follows:

1. go to [the _APIs_ section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis);
2. click on _Create API_;
3. define a _Name_ for your API (e.g., "Golang API");
4. define an _Identifier_ for it (e.g., `https://my-golang-api`);
5. and click on the _Create_ button (leave the _Signing Algorithm_ with RS256).

![Creating an Auth0 API to represent a Golang backend](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/golang-angular/creating-an-auth0-api.png)

Then, to run your API, you will have to issue the following commands:

```bash
# set env variables
export AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER=<YOUR_AUTH0_API>
export AUTH0_DOMAIN=<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>.auth0.com

go run main.go
```

> **Note:** You will have to replace `<YOUR_AUTH0_API>` with the identifier you set in your Auth0 API while creating it. Also, you will have to replace `<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>` with the subdomain you chose while creating your Auth0 account.

## Developing a To-Do List Application with Angular

Now that you have your backend sorted out, you will proceed with the creation of the frontend app with Angular. This application will consist of a simple home page with a button to redirect users to the to-do list. To access this list, users will have to be authenticated.

### Initializing the Angular Project

For starter, you will have to scaffold your new Angular project. You will do this in a new directory called `ui` inside the project root of your Golang. To create this directory and to scaffold your Angular application, you will use the Angular CLI tool. So, head to the project root of your Golang API and issue the following command:

```bash
# make sure your are on your backend project root
ng new ui
```

This will place a new Angular quick-start project inside the `ui` directory. Now, you need to go into this new directory and download all your project's dependencies. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
# move into the ui directory
cd ui

# install all dependencies
npm install
```

The last command issued will look at the `package.json` file and see what are the dependencies defined there so it can download everything.

Then, another thing you will need to do before start writing your application is to add CDN links to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). These libraries (or UI frameworks) will help your application look a little bit better without the need of investing too much time on CSS files and icons. So, open the `./ui/src/index.html` file and replace its contents with this:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Auth0 Golang Example</title>
  <base href="/">

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.1.0/css/all.css">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
</body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, the last change that you will have to do is to edit the environment files found inside the `./ui/src/environments` directory. These files will act as global variables for your application and distinguish between whether you are running a local development environment or if you are running in production.

So, first, you will open the `environment.prod.ts` file and replace its content with this:

```js
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  gateway: '',
  callback: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
  domain: '<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>.auth0.com',
  clientId: '<YOUR_AUTH0_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>'
};
```

Then, as you will spend most of your time developing, you will have to open the `environment.ts` file (which is considered the config for your development environment by default) and replace its contents with this:

```js
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  gateway: 'http://localhost:3000',
  callback: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',
  domain: '<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>.auth0.com',
  clientId: '<YOUR_AUTH0_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>'
};
```

In the next section, you will create an Auth0 Application and then you will replace the placeholders used above with your own values.

### Creating an Auth0 Application

Now that you have scaffolded your Angular application, you will need to register it at Auth0 so you can properly offer authentication and authorization features to your users. So, head to [the Applications section of your Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and hit the _Create Application_ button. When Auth0 shows you the form to create your Application, fill in the following information:

- _Name:_ You can name your application with anything that might help you identifying it in the future. For example, "To-Do Angular App".
- _Application Type:_ For this one, you will **have to** choose the _Single Page Web Applications_ option, as this is exactly what you are going to create.

![Creating an Auth0 application for an Angular app.](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/golang-angular/creating-an-auth0-application.png)

Then, when you hit the _Create_ button, Auth0 will redirect you to the _Quick Start_ section of your new application. From there, you will have to move to the _Settings_ section so you can finish configuring your application.

So, now that you are in the _Settings_ section, search for the _Allowed Callback URLs_ field and insert `http://localhost:4200/callback` there. You need this configuration because, after the authentication process, Auth0 will only redirect users to the URLs listed in this field (this is a security measure that Auth0 puts in place). After that, you can hit _Save_ to persist the change and leave this page open. You will copy values from it in a moment.

Now, back into your project, open both the `environment.prod.ts` and `environment.ts` files and replace the placeholders as follows:

- `<YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT>`: In the place of this placeholder, you will have to insert the Auth0 subdomain you chose while creating your account. In the end, you will have something similar to `domain: 'pungyeon.auth0.com'`.
- `<YOUR_AUTH0_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID>`: In the place of this placeholder, you will have to insert the value that Auth0 shows in the _Client ID_ field of your new application. This will be a random string similar to `z4Z09pinlP93aqTVaIBkCzzQ9vjZ6eEX`.

> **Note:** You have to make sure you replace both placeholders on both files. Otherwise, you might end up with a buggy sign in feature.

### Creating the Welcome & Todo Page
First, we will make a new Angular component. We will quickstart this, using the angular-cli:

> ng g c home

Essentially, this is the shortened version of:

> ng generate component home

This will create a new folder in our `app` folder, named `todo` and place four files in the folder:
* home.component.css - for styling our html
* home.component.html - the html for our page
* home.component.spec.ts - testing file (we won't be using this, you are free to delete it)
* home.component.ts - the TypeScript file for all the javascript to support the html page

```
NOTE: The CLI will also automatically add this newly created class to our `app.module.ts`, in the `@NgModule.declarations` section.
```

Our welcome page, will be extremely simple and we will only have to touch our `home.component.html` file and change it to this:

#### ./ui/src/app/home/home.component.html
```html
<div class="c-block">
  <h3> Welcome Home!</h3>
  <a routerLink="/todo">
    <button class="btn-primary"> Show Todo List </button>
  </a>
</div>
```

All we are doing is creating a title with a link (with a nested button) that will redirect the user to `/todo`. We haven't determined the routing yet, so that won't work right now. We will get to that soon.

However, before we do, let's create a todo component in the same way as our home component:

> ng g c todo

### Developing the ToDo Page & Service
Our todo functionality will be split into two, a component (the one we created in the last section) and a service. The service will be in charge of communicating with the backend via. HTTP. This service may then be used by our component, for ease of use, to communicate with our backend and display the correct information retrieved by the service.

So, let's begin by creating our service. Best practice tells us to create a new folder called `service` and place a new file in there named `todo.service.ts`. This file will consist of the following code: 

#### ./ui/src/app/service/todo.service.ts
```js
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
import { environment } from "../../environments/environment";

@Injectable()
export class TodoService {
    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}

    getTodoList() {
        return this.httpClient.get(environment.gateway + '/todo');
    }

    addTodo(todo: Todo) {
        return this.httpClient.post(environment.gateway + '/todo', todo);
    }

    completeTodo(todo: Todo) {
        return this.httpClient.put(environment.gateway + '/todo', todo);
    }

    deleteTodo(todo: Todo) {
        return this.httpClient.delete(environment.gateway + '/todo/' + todo.id);
    }
}

export class Todo {
    id: string;
    message: string;
    complete: boolean;
}
```

Here we are stating that we want to `export` our TodoService class, thereby making it available for other components to use. On initialisation of our class, we expect an HttpClient as input, which will be available for usage of our class (under the property name `this.httpClient`). This pattern is called dependency injection... but that is a topic for another article. 

```
NOTE: the @Injectable() decorator ensures that we can inject the HttpClient. Without this, you will get some strange console errors.
```

At the bottom of the file, we are exporting another class `Todo` which is a mirror of our todo class from our backend. We use this class throughout our project, to ensure a more accurate description in code, what we are sending and retrieving from our backend. The rest of the service is some very basic HTTP calls to our backend. Notice that we are using the `environment.gateway` variable to determine where our http calls are headed, making it easier to change environments.

```
NOTE: This service must also be added to our app.module.ts file, just like all our components. However, since this is a service our components use, we must add it to the 'providers' section in @NgModule. We will also need to add HttpClientModule to the imports section. There is a reference to where and how, at a later point in the tutorial
```

Now, let's use our new todo service, for usage in our todo component. First, let's write our TypeScript logic in the `todo.component.ts` file:

#### ./ui/src/app/todo/todo.component.ts
```js
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { TodoService, Todo } from '../service/todo.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-todo',
  templateUrl: './todo.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./todo.component.css']
})
export class TodoComponent implements OnInit {

  activeTodos: Todo[];
  completedTodos: Todo[]
  todoMessage: string;

  constructor(private todoService: TodoService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getAll();
  }

  getAll() {
    this.todoService.getTodoList().subscribe((data: Todo[]) => {
      this.activeTodos = data.filter((a) => !a.complete);
      this.completedTodos = data.filter((a) => a.complete);
    });
  }

  addTodo() {
    var newTodo : Todo = {
      message: this.todoMessage,
      id: '',
      complete: false
    }
    this.todoService.addTodo(newTodo).subscribe(() => {
      this.getAll();
      this.todoMessage = '';
    });
  }

  completeTodo(todo: Todo) {
    this.todoService.completeTodo(todo).subscribe(() => {
      this.getAll();
    });
  }

  deleteTodo(todo: Todo) {
    this.todoService.deleteTodo(todo).subscribe(() => {
      this.getAll();
    })
  }
}
```

Starting from the `export class TodoComponent`, what we have is three properties, which respectively contain our active todo list, our completed todo list and a user input string. Our constructor of our component will expect a TodoService object and store this as a private property todoService.

The first function of our component, `ngOnInit` is a built-in standard of angular and derives from the interface `OnInit`. Essentially and implementation on `OnInit`, will wait for the component to be loaded, before executing the `ngOnInit` function. Essentially, we are waiting to retrieve data, until our component has loaded successfully. In our function, we are executing the method `getAll`. This method, will invoke the `todoService.getTodoList` function. As we know, this function is an http call to our backend to get all of our todo items. The HttpClient in angular does not return with the response, but rather with an Observable. Essentially, this is an object, which we can 'subscribe' to and then whenever new data is retrieved, we will be notified and can hereby respond in some way or another. In this scenario, we are using the observable more like a callback, but I strongly recommend reading up on RxJs and Observables. They are super useful in modern Javascript.

Anyway... the `getAll` function subscribes to data from the `todoService.getTodoList` and whenever data is received, will assigned all active todos to our `activeTodos`, by filtering out any complete items, and do the opposite for our `completedTodos` property. The rest of our class methods are corresponding to our todo service, which in turn was mapped up against our backend api. In other words, we have an add, complete and delete, and whenever an operation is performed, we update our todo list, by retrieving the data again with `getAll`.

Now that our TypeScript logic is done, here is our HTML code:

#### ./ui/src/app/todo/todo.component.html
```html
<h3> Todos </h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Complete</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr *ngFor="let todo of activeTodos">
      <td>{{todo.id}}</td>
      <td>{{todo.message}}</td>
      <td>
        <button *ngIf="!todo.complete" class="btn btn-secondary" (click)="completeTodo(todo)">
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i>
        </button>
        <button *ngIf="todo.complete" class="btn btn-success" disabled>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i>
        </button>

        <button class="btn btn-danger" (click)="deleteTodo(todo)">
            <i class="fa fa-trash"></i>
        </button>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Completed</h3>
<table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Complete</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr *ngFor="let todo of completedTodos">
        <td>{{todo.id}}</td>
        <td>{{todo.message}}</td>
        <td>
          <button *ngIf="!todo.complete" class="btn btn-secondary" (click)="completeTodo(todo)">
            <i class="fa fa-check"></i>
          </button>
          <button *ngIf="todo.complete" class="btn btn-success" disabled>
            <i class="fa fa-check"></i>
          </button>
  
          <button class="btn btn-danger" (click)="deleteTodo(todo)">
              <i class="fa fa-trash"></i>
          </button>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
<input placeholder="description..." [(ngModel)]="todoMessage">
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="addTodo()"> Add </button>
```

Our todo html is essentially two tables, that use the `*ngFor` directive to iterate over all the todo items in our variable activeTodos and completedTodos, which have been set by the `getAll` function. The table then contains the id and message of the todo item, as well as two button which will complete and delete the given todo. We also indicate whether the todo item has been completed already. We do this using an `*ngIf` directive. If the `todo.complete` property is false, we show an active green button, and if the todo is already completed, we show a grey disabled button.

```
NOTE: It would be best practice to extract these tables as a component by themselves. But for the simplicity of this tutorial, I have chosen to keep this in a single file.
```

At the very bottom of the html page, we have an input string and a button whose click is mapped to our `addTodo` function. This is what gives our users the possibility of adding new todo items. The input content is mapped to our `todoMessage` variable via. our ngModel directive. This directive works like a two-way binding, meaning that the variable is tied to the input element and the element is tied to the variable, should one change, so will the other. This is why our `addTodo` function creates a new Todo item, using the `todoMessage` variable.

Let's also add a little bit of style to our local css styling file `todo.component.css`. Keep in mind, the css in this file, will only be applied to our `TodoComponent`:

#### ./ui/src/app/todo/todo.component.css
```css
button {
    width: auto;
    margin: 5px;
}

td {
    vertical-align: unset;
}
```

If we were to spin up our project now, none of our hard work would show. We aren't routing our clients anyway and even if we were, we are not authenticated to get the todo list from our backend. So, let's setup routing together with an authentication service next, so we can get access to our data.

### Setting up Routing and Securing it with Auth0
We will start by creating our authentication service. This service will be using the Auth0 CDN import, which was inserted at the start of this article. Keep in mind, that this is an in-memory authentication service, the authentication token that we retrieve will not be saved anywhere, so if a user is to reload the web page, they will have to re-authorize against auth0. For this authentication service, we will be using that javascript auth0 library. To install this, use the following command:

> npm install --save auth0-js

```
NOTE: We could also use localStorage for this, however, this has been deemed against best-practice and unsafe. There are other measures to save session state, but that will be for another article.
```

Either way, our authentication service, will look like this:

#### ./ui/src/app/service/auth.service.ts
```js
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment";
import { HttpClient, HttpErrorResponse, HttpHeaders } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";

import * as auth0 from 'auth0-js';

(window as any).global = window;

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
    constructor(public router: Router)  {}

    access_token: string;
    id_token: string;
    expires_at: string;

    auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
        clientID: 'bpF1FvreQgp1PIaSQm3fpCaI0A3TCz5T',
        domain: environment.domain,
        responseType: 'token id_token',
        audience: 'https://' + environment.domain + '/userinfo',
        redirectUri: environment.callback,
        scope: 'openid'
    });

    public login(): void {
        this.auth0.authorize();
    }

    // ...
    public handleAuthentication(): void {
        this.auth0.parseHash((err, authResult) => {
            if (authResult && authResult.accessToken && authResult.idToken) {
                window.location.hash = '';
                this.setSession(authResult);
                this.router.navigate(['/home']);
            } else if (err) {
                this.router.navigate(['/home']);
                console.log(err);
            }
        });
    }

    private setSession(authResult): void {
        // Set the time that the Access Token will expire at
        const expiresAt = JSON.stringify((authResult.expiresIn * 1000) + new Date().getTime());
        this.access_token = authResult.accessToken;
        this.id_token = authResult.idToken;
        this.expires_at = expiresAt;
    }

    public logout(): void {
        this.access_token = null;
        this.id_token = null;
        this.expires_at = null;
        // Go back to the home route
        this.router.navigate(['/']);
    }

    public isAuthenticated(): boolean {
        // Check whether the current time is past the
        // Access Token's expiry time
        const expiresAt = JSON.parse(this.expires_at || '{}');
        return new Date().getTime() < expiresAt;
    }

    public createAuthHeaderValue(): string {
        if (this.id_token == "") {
            "";
        }
        return 'Bearer ' + this.id_token;
    }
}
```

As you can see, we have the familiar `@Injectable()` decorator, which we use for injecting an angular Router into our service on initialisation. We then define three string properties and a single `auth0.WebAuth` object. This object is what is used for authenticating against Auth0, so we will need to use the information from our environment files. The `auth0.WebAuth` object will in turn use this information to send to Auth0 and inform which application we are trying to get access to.

Our `login` function is quite simple looking, but essentially, this will initialise authentication with Auth0, redirecting the client to the Auth0 login site. If the user is authenticated, they will be sent to the specified callback location, with a tailing hash on the URL. This url will be parsed by the `handleAuthentication` function, which if successful calls the `setSession` function, which very simple sets our three properties with the appropriate values.

The `lougout` function resets all tokens from memory and the `isAuthenticated` method just returns whether the token as expired or not. We will use this later, for getting an authentication status of our client.

Lastly, we have our `createAuthHeaderValue`, returns a string in the form of an `Authorization` bearer header. In other words, it appends the `id_token` property, to 'Bearer '.

Easy peasy! Just remember to add this service to the `providers` section of our `app.module.ts` file.

Now we need to create our callback component, which will be done like the other components:

> ng g c callback

Change the `callback.component.ts` to the following:

#### ./ui/src/app/callback/callback.component.ts
```js
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from '../service/auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-callback',
  templateUrl: './callback.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./callback.component.css']
})
export class CallbackComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private auth: AuthService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.auth.handleAuthentication();
  }
}
```

All we are doing, is invoking the `handleAuthentication` method of our authentication service, once the component is initialised, parsing the url hash and redirecting the client to '/home'.

```
If you want you can add your favourite loading gif to this component, to let your users know that something is happening. However, this is not mandatory.
```

Once we have set our authentication session with our callback component, we need to make sure that all future requests include our retrieved token, in the `Authorization` header. To do this, we will create yet another service. So, create a new file: `./ui/src/app/service/token.interceptor.ts`. This is our interceptor service, which will intercept all of our outgoing requests and add an authentication header, if a token is available.

#### ./ui/src/app/service/token.interceptor.ts
```js
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from "@angular/common/http";
import { AuthService } from "src/app/service/auth.service";
import { Observable } from "rxjs/internal/Observable";

@Injectable()
export class TokenInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {}
  intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    request = request.clone({
      setHeaders: {
        Authorization: this.auth.createAuthHeaderValue()
      }
    });
    return next.handle(request);
  }
}
```

This service implements HttpInterceptor, which has the constraint of needing the `intercept` function, which will be revoked upon an http request. Much like our middleware in our backend, this will return a 'next request', which basically forwards the modified request to the original destination. The `intercept` function in this case is quite simple. We are cloning in the incoming request, but adding an Authorization header, using our `auth.createAuthHeaderValue` from our AuthService. Remember, if no token is found, nothing is added. Once the request has been altered, we invoke the `next.handle` passing the modified request.

The reason why we are creating this service, is to ensure that all of our requests contain the appropriate Authorization header. Centralising the header management like this, makes it easier in the future, if changes are made to authentication or if new requests are added to the project.

To include this in our `app.module.ts` file, we will need to add the following object to our providers array, importing all the necessary dependencies:

```js
{
    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
    useClass: TokenInterceptor,
    multi: true
}
```

Almost there! Now, we need to change our `app.component.ts` page to include routing and actually define our routes. Let's start by creating our routing definition. Create a new file: `./ui/src/app/app-routing.module.ts` and in this file, write the following code:

#### ./ui/src/app/app-routing.module.ts
```js
import { HomeComponent } from "./home/home.component";
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { AuthGuardService } from "./service/auth-guard.service";
import { CallbackComponent } from "./callback/callback.component";
import { TodoComponent } from "./todo/todo.component";

const routes: Routes = [
    { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
    { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
    { path: 'todo', component: TodoComponent,  canActivate: [AuthGuardService] },
    { path: 'callback', component: CallbackComponent }
  ];
  
  @NgModule({
    imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ],
    exports: [ RouterModule ]
  })
  export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

The only important aspect of this, if our constant routes. This defines an array of paths. Our root path will redirect to our HomeComponent (and os will '/home'). Our todo path will redirect to our TodoComponent and callback to our CallbackComponent. However, you will notice, that the todo path is slightly different, in that it is using the `canActivate` property and using the `AuthGuardService`. Now... we haven't written our AuthGuardService yet, so let's do that right away.

The `canActivate` property basically asks a service (which implements CanActivate) for a boolean response of whether or not a user is able to activate this page. So let's quickly create this service as well. Create a new file:  `./ui/src/app/service/auth-guard.service.ts`, which will contain the logic to whether or not a user is authentorized.

#### ./ui/src/app/service/auth-guard.service.ts
```js
import { CanActivate, Router } from "@angular/router";
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment";
import { HttpErrorResponse } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";


@Injectable()
export class AuthGuardService implements CanActivate {
    constructor(private auth: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

    canActivate(): boolean {
        if (this.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
            return true;
        }

        this.auth.login()
    }
}
```

Really a quite simple service, which calls our AuthService, asking whether the current user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, we will return a true forwarding the user to the request route. If not, we will invoke the `auth.login` function, which will send our user to the Auth0 login page.

Now, we will include our routing and our auth service in our `app.module.ts` file, so the finalised version will look as such:

#### ./ui/src/app/app.module.ts
```js
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { HttpClientModule, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AuthGuardService } from './service/auth-guard.service';
import { AuthService } from 'src/app/service/auth.service';
import { CallbackComponent } from 'src/app/callback/callback.component';
import { TodoComponent } from './todo/todo.component';
import { TodoService } from './service/todo.service';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { TokenInterceptor } from 'src/app/service/token.interceptor';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    CallbackComponent,
    TodoComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [AuthGuardService, AuthService, TodoService, {
    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
    useClass: TokenInterceptor,
    multi: true
  }],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

For the routing, as you can see, we have imported our `AppRoutingModule`. So, now we can finally include this routing to our application, which will be the last part of this tutorial.

## Putting it all together
So, it's been a long while, but now we are finally going to add routing to the application. As well as creating a little menu bar, for navigation and logging out. First we need to edit the `./ui/src/app/app.component.ts` to add our AuthService to our AppComponent.

#### ./ui/src/app/app.component.ts
```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from 'src/app/service/auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {}
}
```

Next, we need to edit the `./ui/src/app/app.component.html` file and set it to the following code:

#### ./ui/src/app/app.component.html
```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="navbar-header">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Auth0 - Angular</a>
  
        <button
          class="btn btn-light btn-margin"
          routerLink="/">
            Home
        </button>
  
        <button
          class="btn btn-light btn-margin"
          *ngIf="!auth.isAuthenticated()"
          (click)="auth.login()">
            Log In
        </button>
  
        <button
          class="btn btn-light btn-margin "
          *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()"
          (click)="auth.logout()">
            Log Out
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
  
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

We are creating a new nav bar including functions from our auth service to login and logout. Underneath this nav bar, we are including the `router-outlet` component. This is what tells Angular to ask the routing module, which page it should load.

```
NOTE: As with our todo list tables, following best practice, we would have created a new component for our navigation bar.
```

It's a very common practice to include the navigation bar together with the routing component. This ensures that the menu is present on all of our pages, without having to reload the navigation bar for each individual page.

The final touch to our project, will be adding some style to it. So, let's add the following code to our `style.css` file:

#### ./ui/src/styles.css
```css
.c-block {
    width: 50%;
    margin-left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    text-align: center;
}

button {
    margin: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    width: 200px;
}

img {
    margin: 20px;
}

h3 {
    margin-top: 30px;
}
```

Finally, we are done! Our todo list is working as intended and we can now rejoice in creating a todo list that only users which we have specified are granted access to. The last thing we need to do is build our ui and start our web server. Build the UI with the following command:

> ng build --prod 

This will place a few transpiled and compressed javascript files in the `./ui/dist` folder. Which (luckily) is where we are serving our static files from, with our web server.

So, go to the root of the project and first set the environment variables:

> export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=[your client id]

> export AUTH0_DOMAIN=https://[your domain]/

Finally, we can run our server:

> go run main.go

And the server will be up and running! Go to `localhost:3000/` and celebrate by creating all your secured todo items!

```
NOTE: You can also compile the go code into a binary using the command: go build -o todo-server main.go, which will create an executable file called todo-server. The file will be compiled to your system, but that can be modified using the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables, read more here: https://golang.org/cmd/compile/
```

## Conclusion
So, we finally made it! The application itself that we created was pretty simple. Just a todo list, where we can add delete and complete some todo items. However, the framework around our application is quite sound. We have handled authentication via. Auth0, creating a very strong starting point for our application, by starting with security in mind.

Adding features to our application becomes a lot easier, once we have established a strong fundament in security. We can add different todo lists for different users, relatively easily, without having to worry about how this will affect our application down the road. Using a third party security solution like Auth0, is also a great advantage, because we can rest assured that this solution will keep our application data safe. With a few changes here and there (such as serving our API and static files over HTTPS), we could quite confidently deploy this code to production. 

I hope this article has been helpful, and has given some insight to how easy it is to implement Auth0 as a third-party authentication service, as well as using Angular as a frontend and Golang as a backend. Feedback and questions are very welcome!
